# The T Operating System

A very much work-in-progress OS & kernel for learning rust, x86-64 asm and C.
-> currently 100% skidded :-)

i want: (totally realistic)

- TCP/IP stack
- own bootloader (that works with UEFI)
- some sort of shell (?)
- filesystem maybe (?)
- actually make the os
- permission rings (?)

more realistic:

- come up with something myself to write text to the screen (that's not the vga buffer).
